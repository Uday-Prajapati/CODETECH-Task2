# Overview:
The Student Grade Tracker is a Java program designed to help track and manage student grades across multiple subjects. The program allows the user to input grades, calculate an average, and display the results in terms of numeric averages, letter grades, and GPA. It also provides an interactive interface where users can exit or calculate results dynamically during the input process.

# Key Activities:
# 1. Interactive Grade Input:
Prompt users to input grades for predefined subjects (English, Hindi, Maths, etc.).
Validate grades to ensure they are within the range of 0-100.

# 2. Dynamic Command Options:
Allow users to exit the program anytime by typing Exit.
Enable immediate calculation of averages and grades using the Calculate command during input.

# 3. Grade Calculation and Display:
Compute the average of the entered grades.
Assign a corresponding letter grade based on predefined criteria.
Calculate GPA on a 4.0 scale.
Display individual grades, average grade, letter grade, and GPA.

# Technology Used:
# Programming Language: Java
# Tools:
Scanner for interactive console input.
Exception handling (try-catch) to manage invalid input.

# Control Structures:
Loops and conditional statements to validate and process input.
Methods for modularity and code reusability (e.g., calculateAndDisplayGrades).

# Key Insights: 
# 1. Interactive Design:
The program uses clear instructions and options (Exit, Calculate) to create a user-friendly interface for grade management.

# 2. Input Validation:
Validation ensures users cannot input invalid grades, improving reliability and accuracy.

# 3. Modular Programming:
Encapsulating the calculation logic in a separate method (calculateAndDisplayGrades) enhances readability and maintainability.

# 4. Scalability:
The program's modular design allows for easy extension, such as adding more subjects or introducing weighted averages.
